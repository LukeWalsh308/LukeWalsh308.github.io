I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Liverpool Management School, from which I also hold a master's and bachelor's degree. My research lies at the intersection of education, labour, and public economics, with a particular focus on how policy reforms shape individual outcomes such as human capital investment.

My job market paper examines the impact of higher tution costs on university participation, attainment, and subsequent labour market outcomes in the UK, using linked administrative microdata and a difference-in-discontinuities design. In my other work, I study the effects of pay-transparency laws, minimum-wage thresholds, as well as algorithmic pricing in rental housing markets.

I will be on the job market in the 2025/26 academic year.
