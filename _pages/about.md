I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Liverpool Management School, from which I also hold a master's and bachelor's degree. My research lies at the intersection of education, labour, and public economics, with a particular focus on how policy reforms shape individual outcomes such as human capital investment.

My job market paper, “Investing in Your Future? How the Cost of University Shapes Labour Market Outcomes”, employs a difference-in-discontinuities design with rich administrative data (LEO: HESA, HMRC, NPD) to show how the 2012 UK tuition fee reform shaped both participation and longer-term earnings and employment trajectories. I find, consistent with the theoretical literature on human capital investment, that the increase
in tuition fees induces a more rational sorting of student university and subject choice based on their lifetime returns, with minimal reduction in positive spillovers. This work is especially topical in the context of the current budget constraints universities face due to the declining real value of student tuition fees, and provides a basis for future tuition fee increases while including measures to actively shield low-income individuals from the effects of higher costs.

Beyond my job market paper, I am pursuing a set of projects at the intersection of labour economics and the economics of education. One line of work examines the reform that increased the compulsory school leaving age in England, first from 16 to 17 and later from 17 to 18. This staggered change provides an exogenous shift in years of mandatory schooling, which I exploit to provide causal evidence on the returns to education, addressing long-standing concerns about endogeneity in this literature. In another paper, I investigate how adverse labour market conditions at the time of graduation affect early-career outcomes. Rather than relying on geographic variation, I leverage changes in the graduate premium over time to identify within-cohort effects, allowing me to more cleanly isolate the impact of recessions on graduates entering the labour market.

In addition to my work on education, I also pursue projects on labour markets and regulation in the United States. One paper studies pay-transparency legislation and shows that granting workers the right to discuss salaries led to an increase in pay-discrimination lawsuits. In another, I examine recent city-level bans on a major rental-pricing algorithm accused of facilitating price coordination among landlords, a policy area that continues to attract federal attention. I also plan to extend this line of research to explore the labour-market effects of tariffs and minimum wages.

I will be on the job market in the 2025/26 academic year. A link to my JMP can be found below:
