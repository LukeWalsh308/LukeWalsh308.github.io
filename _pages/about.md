I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Liverpool Management School, from which I also hold a master's and bachelor's degree. My research lies at the intersection of education, labour, and public economics, with a particular focus on how policy reforms shape individual outcomes such as human capital investment.

My job market paper, “Investing in Your Future? How the Cost of University Shapes Labour Market Outcomes”, employs a difference-in-discontinuities design with rich administrative data to show how the 2012 UK tuition fee reform shaped both participation and longer-term earnings and employment trajectories. I find, consistent with the theoretical literature on human capital investment, that the increase
in tuition fees induces a more rational sorting of student university and subject choice based on their lifetime returns, with minimal reduction in positive spillovers. This work is especially topical in the context of the current budget constraints universities face due to the declining real value of student tuition fees, and provides a basis for future tuition fee increases while including measures to actively shield low-income individuals from the effects of higher costs.

I am developing a broader research agenda on labour and education, including projects on compulsory schooling reforms in England and on how graduating in recessions shapes early-career outcomes. Beyond education, I study labour-market regulation in the US, with work on pay-transparency laws, rental-platform bans, and future projects on tariffs and minimum wages.

I will be on the job market in the 2025/26 academic year. A link to my JMP can be found below:
