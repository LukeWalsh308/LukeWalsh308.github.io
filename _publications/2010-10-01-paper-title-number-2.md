excerpt: '**Abstract:** Pay secrecy bans have been suggested as a solution to wage gaps. In this paper, we find
no evidence that these policies have any impact on wages, but they do lead to an increase
in lawsuits. Using Current Population Survey (CPS) data we exploit the variation in US
states that passed these laws between 1977 and 2021. We find no evidence of wage changes
or changes in wage gaps. However, using discrimination complaints filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) between 2009 and 2021, we find the number
of lawsuits filed due to workplace discrimination increased by 25-40'
